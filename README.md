Setting up a Wallet:
Choose your wallet here 
You'll note that there are a variety of options. 
My wallet recommendations: 
Hardware wallet (best security): Trezor or Ledger Nano S
Desktop wallet: Electrum
Android wallet: Samourai Wallet
iPhone wallet: GreenAddress
Web wallet: BitGo
Note that it is NOT recommended that Bitcoin newcomers use the Bitcoin Core wallet. The Core wallet is much more resource intensive than other wallets and will not function properly unless it is running constantly on an active Internet connection.
